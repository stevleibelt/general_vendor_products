This helps for the case that the halfbike is always leaning into one direction, even on an even road.

The following steps are done assuming your halfbike tends to lean more to the left side.

* lock the break by using a string and put it around the handlebar
* step on the left rear tire
* push the front wheel sideways to the desired direction (right for this example case)
* unlock the break
* take a ride and repeat if this issue still exists
